# Contributing to Level 13

## General

Level 13 is mainly a personal side project but it has also been improved by bug reports and fixes from the community. Bug reports, suggestions and small fixes are very welcome, but please keep in mind that it might take a while for your contributions to be reviewed.

## Issues

You can use issues to submit bug reports or to suggest new features or enhancements to existing features.

* Only submit one bug or feature request per issue
* Before submitting a new issue/suggestion, check that it hasn't already been posted
* For bugs, write down what happened and what you expected to happen
* Mention the version number you were playing (you can find it in the bottom left of the page)

## Pull requests

If you want to contribute a small bug-fix then by all means do so. If you are interested in doing bigger refactoring or new behaviour please get in touch with me first. For the time being please refrain from sending pull requests containing bigger refactoring or new behaviour without getting in touch with me first.
