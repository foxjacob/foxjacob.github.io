**Credits :**
- [MarcoWorms](https://github.com/MarcoWorms) because he's the one who made the basics of PokeIdle. I just asked him to take the game in hands in order to have an updated game.
- [piiih](https://github.com/piiih) for helping me in the first days of PokeIdle. When the game didn't have any name or any Pokemon inside.
- [Fastigium](https://github.com/Fastigium) for making the game so awesome. Evolution, Shiny, so much help, so much amazing !
- [racken / renlok](https://github.com/renlok) for the Pokedex !

A subreddit for the game is now open ! You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokeidle/) but like the game, still in progress !

Time to thanks some websites for sprites data. Without [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/), no sprites would be in game !
Moreover, huge thanks to the [Smogon XY Sprite Project](http://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/xy-sprite-project-read-1st-post-release-v1-1-on-post-3240.3486712/) without that all recents gens could not have been possible !

WIP.

Planned (everything major is done now, let's try to make the game EVEN better) :

- Storage System
- Giving events again and again

My coding skills are really really (when I say really it's really) limited. So any help would be more than apprecied. Just trying to bring some ideas and doing the boring stuff.

Changelog :

NGGYU NGLYD (10/08/2017) :
- **The Release version** ! Finally ! After almost 6 months of work, the game is finally in its final form. Everything wanted have been added. It was a long work but it's done. The NGGYU NGLYD version is out ! This update just bring more control for events, and this way allow people to enjoy events ! A last little update will come soon. Now its only about focusing on future Pokemon games and events.

NGGYU 1.9.4 (08/19/2017) :
- **Pokedex fixes** ! Nothing major, but the Pokedex is now more clear and new system of displaying Pokemon in order to be more simple AND do-able for users who want to make a PokeDex OR a LivingDex. More informations about how the game displays everything in the update post in Reddit.

- **Remembering the last place visited** ! Really a QoL update. Now when you refresh the game, the last location is saved, so you'll not have to move from Pallet Town anymore !

NGGYU 1.9.3 (08/16/2017) :
- **Catching options** ! Update done by racken, once again ! No more "Try to catch", but two neat options, called "All" and "New". "All" will catch any Pokemon defeated, so the same option as before. But the "New" is here and will catch Pokemon you don't have in your team, and will ignore any Pokemon already in your team.

NGGYU 1.9.2 (08/13/2017) :
- **Manage Team update** ! Wanted for a long time, now people can order team with some simple option like Pokedex, Level, or even the Power ! No more need to move up / down in order to keep a LivingDex updated etc etc. Maybe more options will be added in the future, but the basics are done !

NGGYU 1.9.1 (08/12/2017) :
- **Special Stats** ! First step of the battle revamp system, Pokemon has now their Special Stats applied to the game. Before, only Physical stats were in the formula of damage (Attack + Defense) making Physical Pokemon overpowered compared to special Pokemon too much weak. It's fixed for the moment (a better system can be added in the future for a v3 of the Metagame), and now the average of Special Attack + Special Defense is now working. 

NGGYU 1.9.0 (08/09/2017) :
- **Pokedex** ! Done by racken / renlok, it's finally here. It's still a first version of the Pokedex, but it's working well. You can check Pokemon you've caught, you've released or you've missed. Compatible Normal AND Shiny versions.

NGGYU 1.8.0 (08/06/2017) :
- **Saving system** ! Huge update this time ! It's a basic system for any Idle game, and it's finally here and live ! From now, if you use more than one device (PC / Mobile), you'll be able to move your save without any problem. Work with any browser etc. You just need a way to send the encrypted datas (like by mail, cloud etc) ! In order to use that, you'll have to :
1) Click on "Save" and copy the huge letters thing.
2) On your new device, click on "load" and paste this huge combinaison of letters.
3) Enjoy !
4) You can do it again for moving it to the first device. As much as you want.
Of course, this works as a backup system in case you clean your computer ! Tell me if you find any bugs, it's compatible with your actual save of course !

- **Chrome update** : The manage team has been edited once again to be more light on Chrome. Should help people with the game and some lags on this browser !

NGGYU 1.7.2 (08/03/2017) :
- **New Formes** : It was something missing to PokeIdle. After getting a good feedback about the Multi Branched Evolutions solution, I've decided to extand this to formes. Now, you can have and switch between formes of almost every Pokemon available. A few are missing, because I still need to think about how to add them, but 80% of them have been added. You'll be able to find the list on the Reddit post. All sprites has been updated, everything working fine.

NGGYU 1.7.1 (08/01/2017) :
- **Test Update about Mutli Branched Evolutions** : So this update is quite special. For once, it's not coming with a LOT of things (as for now) but it's something I need feedback and wanted to try. I've changed some evolutions in order to make them working in the case there are one of more choices of evolution. For example before, Tyrogue was only able to evolve into Hitmontop. Now, once you have evolved your Tyrogue, you can change it to the form you want (so Hitmontop / Hitmonchan / Hitmonlee) ! So yes, you can switch as much as you want. But it's better to have this solution rather than having them in the wild. In the near future, a pop-up message will give you the choice for ONE evolution (and not reversible). That's why I need feedback. To see if people like or not. Here's a list of Pokemon affected by this update : 

 Vileplume / Bellossom, Poliwrath / Politoed, Hitmonlee / Hitmonchan / Hitmontop, Ninjask / Shedinja, Huntail / Gorebyss, Wormadam / Mothim

If this is approved, the 1.7.1 will come with some changes in routes and evolutions.

NGGYU 1.7.0 (07/31/2017) :
- **Alola** ! It's done. I thought it'd take me weeks to make this only. But once again, i've coded like non-stop to make this done in 48h. New Pokemon, new forms, new routes, new evolutions, everything should be working well ! It's the last region for the moment. And except some special forms, no more Pokemon to add, the game is **COMPLETE** for that. You can have all 802 basic Pokemon in the game !

NGGYU 1.6.1 (07/30/2017) :
- **Major bug fix** : Before, catching a lot of Pokemon (I saw a lot, but around 150/180 the bug starts to occur) was making the game lagging a lot or even making it to crash. This has been found on Chrome first, thinking it was a typical Chrome error, but at the end, it's really a bug of the game. So this has been fixed, and now you can catch and deal with many Pokemon. For example catching 600+ Pokemon is working without any lag or anything. So this is fixed for good !

- **Minor bugs fix** : During this past week a lot of little things has been fixed. Shiny Gen 6 sprites are now here, some missing evolutions or routes has been fixed too. A lot of little tweaks to make the game better !

NGGYU 1.6.0 (07/25/2017) :
- **Kalos** ! And only one hour after Gen 5, a new region is already here. But this time, I did the routes myself, so that's why it's a CUSTOMED Kalos. All Pokemon are findable anyway. For the moment, it'll be the solution, the maps will be edited later with right and correct mapping (no idea how to do it without messing too much for the moment)

NGGYU 1.5.0 (07/25/2017) :
- **Unova** ! And one more region done ! This one was really hard to do. I used BW2 mapping in order to get it done. Coming with the new Pokemon, the evolutions (even the megas this time) and new routes ! No bugs should be here (maybe for evolutions) ! This means the end of the first event too. Let's focus on something new right now.

NGGYU 1.4.1 (07/24/2017) : 
- **Minor Update** : Gen 4 Mega Evolutions and Sprites added. Level 100 as always ! Lopunny, Garchomp, Lucario, Abomasnow and Gallade.

NGGYU 1.4.0 (07/24/2017) :
- **Sinnoh** : Gen 4 is here ! Are you ready to face the Pokemon at the origin of everything ? Arceus is waiting for fighting ! More Pokemon, more routes, more evolutions as always. Should be working fine, maybe some missing evolutions or some stupidity for that, but should be alright !
- **Event Region** : A special place for the future Events in the game. Be ready, it's coming really really soon !

NGGYU 1.3.2 (07/23/2017) :
- **Minor Update** : Added Shiny sprites for megas. From Gen 1 to Gen 3 so 100% of the sprites are now in game. Let's focus on something new and important now !

NGGYU 1.3.1 (07/23/2017) :
- **Shiny Pokemon** ! This was the base of the game, the reason I took it in hand, and now it's finally a thing ! You can find Shiny Pokemon anywhere with a 1/8192 probability ! Evolutions are working too, and the system is now good to work ! PokeIdle is now really a farming game if you're a Shiny Hunter !

- **Update on the Catch System** ! Because of adding Shiny, rethinking the catching system was necessary. I didn't want to bring a 100% catch rate on Shiny Pokemon, and anyway players should have to check the "Try to catch" and so bothering with a lot of useless Pokemon. So, I thought differently, and I've found the right thing : When a Shiny pops up, the game will trhow the **BEST** ball in your inventory. So this way you have the greatest chance to catch the Shiny. Automaticly. No need to check the game or anything. And this way, people will still struggle to have Shiny Legendary, so more challenge !

NGGYU 3.1 (07/22/2017) :
- Proper Region navigation ! No more LONG list of routes. Now with the new regions, you have a button on the top of the routes list in order to be able to switch region to region. This way the look of the game is really cleaner but nothing more in gameplay side with this.
- Gen 3 Megas added ! This is more important. They are available for a few hours, but sprites were needed before officialy updating to 3.1 ! **Meta Metagross back sprite is still not a thing, so for the moment well... It's a simple front sprite, will try to find something in order to fix that**

NGGYU 3.0 (07/21/2017) :
- **Hoenn** : Trumpets ! Since this game will never let you down, it was really fast to add all the Gen 3. More areas, more Pokemon, more evolutions. Everything should work fine. The issues are here for any bugs ! Enjoy the water !

NGGYU 2.1 (07/20/2017) :
- Gen 2 Megas added ! You can the 6 Mega-Evolutions from Jotho with sprites ! Ampharos, Steelix, Scizor, Heracross, Houndoom and Tyranitar can evolve level 100 !
- Fixed the HUGE database problem for people with old save. No need of swiping the save data for old players (Mr. Mime is not a friend anymore). Shot me a PM anywhere you want if you have ANY PROBLEM with save loading.

NGGYU 2.0 (07/19/2017) :
- **Jotho** : Nothing more than that, the 2G ! New routes, new Pokemon, new evolutions. Everything is ready to start a new adventure !

NGGYU 1.2 (07/16/17) :
- **Real Catch Rate !** It was asking for a long time, it's now done. Using a simple formula (but close to reals mechanics), Pokemon have their own catch rate. No more stupid probability or anything. A Pidgey with an ultraball will be 100% caught, while a Mewtwo with a Pokeball will be almost impossible to catch.

NGGYU 1.1 (07/15/17) :
- Megas Pokemon ! Right after the Evolve button, it was the first thing to do. You can now have Megas Pokemon once your pokemon is level 100. However, they are not reversibles, they are perma megas and they stay like that for more collecting stuff.

NGGYU 1.0 (07/15/17) :
- Evolve Button ! Finally ! It was long, I know. It was boring, I know. But PokeIdle is now in 1.0 ! The evolve button is here. In the manage team, once your Pokemon is ready to evolve you can choose to evolve it OR NOT. This means that Mega Pokemon are coming REALLY soon (aka a few hours), and MORE gens soon too. Huge thanks to [Fastigium](https://github.com/Fastigium) for completing the work !

NGGYU.9 (03/20/17) :
- Manage Team updated : Maybe not an important thing, but it needs to be clear. From now, you can order AND release with the 'Manage Team' checked. So no more 'First' button on the page, and changed to up & down buttons !

NGGYU.8 (03/18/17) :
- Auto-healer : Finally ! Now the game heals itself, and you can enjoy the game at 100% as an idle game.
- Changed "Release" to "Manage Team" : For future updates

NGGYU.7 (03/14/17) :
- Finally a way to order Pokemon team. FOR THE MOMENT there's a button "First!" just click on it and the Pokemon will be on the top of the list. It does the job for the moment perfectly. Huge thanks to piiih for this feature !

NGGYU.6 (03/12/17) :
- Another huge clean in the original code (database related)
- Fixing types chart ! (For example Dragon hitting ONLY * .1 on Rock Pokemon)
- Preparing stuff for event days (Bonus of experience OR catch rate for the moment) stay tunned for that !
- Stats for the mega Pokemon of the 1G added ! You can check how to get them in the future, not available
- Finally a favicon
- All Pokemon are now available (I deleted some of them by mistake by redoing the routes)
- **HUGE GAMEPLAY CHANGE** : Before, the game didn't take in consideration Special Stats. This way, Chansey was really under-powered or Pokemon like Mewtwo would be less effective. Before, Pokemon were using only Attack + Defense. Now it's the average of both Physical and Special stats. This should change a lot of things. Keep me updated for any bug or anything.

NGGYU.5 (03/05/17) : 
- Fixed Eeveelutions by being available in the wild
- Fixed some Fairy glitched Pokemon
- Fixed https links with the help of the PR
- Fixed the level 101 glitch (level 100 is the max level, it'll be adjusted if you had a level 101 Pokemon)
- Better catch rate (need feedback for this)
- Updated the CSS in order to have the same looks as before (bad edit before in order to have all areas in the same place)
- **HUGE** update of the database. Deleted 70k of lines for stuff NOT used in game. Edited in order to add new gens without any difficulty. So this will be a thing soon.

NGGYU.4 (03/02/17) :
- Updated the catch rates. 90% of them were missing. Should change the gameplay A LOT.

NGGYU.3 (03/01/17) :
- Areas redone completly. Removed customs areas for matching the real routes from Kanto. CSS need to be updated.

NGGYU.2 (02/28/17) :
- Fixed all the evolutions levels.

NGGYU.1 (02/28/17) :
- Initial Version
