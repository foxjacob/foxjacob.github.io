  <h1>SLDP - Shiny Living Dex(es) Project</h1>
  <div id="intro">
  <h2>What is this thing ?</h2>
  <p>In 2017, i've decided to start a huge project. Starting to get every Shiny on every generation of Pokemon game. How ? With RNG Abuse. It's allows to control and manipulate how Pokemon are generated in games. It started to be a hobby, I've studied more methods, joined the community to help and to discover even more. Once being able to RNG or TAS on any Pokemon game, i've started to do my saves in order to RNG on them. Now that my project is starting to be huge, i've decided to create this (poorly done) website in order to give ideas, motivations to any Shiny lover. Shiny Hunter or RNGer, it doesn't really matter. The important thing is to find new targets or ideas from what i've done. </p>

  <h2>Rules of my project</h2>
  <p>So even if i'm known to break all the rules while rnging... For my project and to create something uniques, i've decided to put some RUDE rules in order to... Except hating myself, i don't know. I could say it's to match the best my vision of Pok√©mon... I think.</p>
  <ol>
	<li>No PID Clones. It's the most important rule for me. If you're wondering what do i call a PID clone is that any Pokemon that shares the same PID with another one is considered as a clone. And so only one of them can be kept. Every result while doing RNG must stay UNIQUE.</li>
	<li>No eggs except if you CAN'T get it in the targeted gen. For example, a Bulbasaur in Gen 5 MUST be done by egg (and no transfer to have Gen 5 as original gen) but in Gen 7, it must be a wild, since it's available.</li>
	<li>Going for wilds rather than going for evolutions. If a Stage 1 or more Pokemon can be found in the wild, it'll be a priority compared to evolving the base stage Pokemon. The only exception is for my BASIC teams since i wanted to get them as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Shiny Locks sucks. And since i want all the Shiny, i'm 300% fine with breaking them'all. No problem with that.</li>
	<li>Shiny Locked Pokemon are a priority compared to Events. For example, i'll keep a Shiny Zygarde done by RNG as stationary than keeping the Event one. Shiny Hunters old reflexs.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Game / Team presentation</h2>
  <p>Before starting this project, I had the problem to have TOO much saves. Like... 3000 saves. For nothing. With thousands of Pokemon and Shiny. It was time to clean everything. I've started to create a list of every Pokemon games, and after, creating a team that could work well. No duplicates except if it's a remake game (like Red / Fire Red duplicates allowed) and of course with a good balanced team. Here's the result for EACH game :</p>
  <p>Gen 1 :
    <ul>
	<li>Red : Charizard / Starmie / Dragonite / Tauros / Chansey / Rhydon</li>
	<li>Blue : Blastoise / Pidgeot / Golem / Jolteon / Gengar / Exeggutor</li>
	<li>Yellow : Pikachu / Venusaur / Charizard / Blastoise / Hitmonlee / Zapdos</li>
</ul></p>
  <p>Gen 2 :
    <ul>
	<li>Gold : Typhlosion / Forretress / Umbreon / Machamp / Xatu / Kingdra</li>
	<li>Silver : Meganium / Togetic / Steelix / Arcanine / Weezing / Lapras</li>
	<li>Crystal : Feraligatr / Donphan / Crobat / Ampharos / Scizor / Espeon</li>
</ul></p>
   <p>Something to continue tbh... The only screen isn't the fun to list every team lulz.</p>
